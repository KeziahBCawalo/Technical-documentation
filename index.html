    	Anime (Japanese: アニメ) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. In Japanese, anime, a term derived from the English word animation, describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Outside of Japan, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan, or to its common style, which has since been adopted by a minority of works produced in other countries.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    	Anime is a style of animation originating in Japan that is characterized by stark colorful graphics depicting vibrant characters in action-filled plots often with fantastic or futuristic themes.

		The history of Japanese anime goes back to the infancy of animation throughout the world. Seitaro Kitayama is one of the first to get involved, since 1917. At the time, however, animation was mostly used in the context of anti-American propaganda. After 1945, and becoming the world’s second largest producer of animation, Japanese people are heavily influenced by number one: the United States.
		</p>

		<p>
		Osamu Tezuka, considered the father of modern manga, becomes famous through the success of Astro Boy (鉄腕アトム, Tetswuan Atomu), which received an animated adaptation in 1963. He is also known for Jungle Emperor Leo (ジャングル大帝, Janguru Taitei), first released between 1965 and 1966.
		</p>

		<p>
		The 60’s have also seen multiple series like Sally the Witch (魔法使いサリー, Mahōtsukai Sarī) in 1966, GeGeGe no Kitarō (ゲゲゲの鬼太郎), in 1967, and Sazae-san (サザエさん) in 1969. The latter became so successful that the series owns a Guinness world record for the longest broadcast (over 45 years!).

        Modern anime follows a typical animation production process, involving storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production. Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. Early anime works were experimental, and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.

      <p>
        The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality. In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause lip sync errors in the Japanese version.

     <p> 
     	Body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall. Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like Crayon Shin-chan completely disregard these proportions, in such a way that they resemble caricatured Western cartoons. 
    </p>

	 <p>
	 	A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes. The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used. Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign. However, not all anime characters have large eyes. For example, the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters. 
	</p>


	 <p>
	 	Anime and manga artists often draw from a defined set of facial expressions to depict particular emotions
		Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and "hair action" is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect. Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga. Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the Pokémon animated series. 
	</p>

	 <p>
		Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts. These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods. For example, a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused. A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare. Another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi (deformed, simplified character designs) figures to comedically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment

      	The opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by J-pop or rock songs, often by reputed bands—as written with the series in mind—but are also aimed at the general music market, therefore it is often alluded once vaguely or not all to the thematic settings or plot of the series. Also, they are often used as incidental music ("insert songs") for each episode to highlight particularly important scenes.

        Anime are often classified by target demographic, including children's (子供, kodomo), girls' (少女, shōjo), boys' (少年, shōnen) and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations. A subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled "R18" in Japan, and are internationally known as hentai (originating from pervert (変態, hentai)). By contrast, some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi, sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse, as typified in the comedic or harem genres; due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of fan service. Some genres explore homosexual romances, such as yaoi (male homosexuality) and yuri (female homosexuality). While often used in a pornographic context, the terms yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves.</p>

	<p>
		Anime's genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification. Gilles Poitras compared the labeling Gundam 0080 and its complex depiction of war as a "giant robot" anime akin to simply labeling War and Peace a "war novel". Science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's Astro Boy and Yokoyama's Tetsujin 28-go. A major subgenre of science fiction is mecha, with the Gundam metaseries being iconic. The diverse fantasy genre includes works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore; examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale InuYasha, and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called Yggdrasil in Ah! My Goddess. Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in Dragon Half, and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film Castle of Cagliostro. Other subgenres found in anime include magical girl, harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, medievalism, and war.</p>

    	Top 10 Anime Studios
      <p>
        <b>1. Studio Bones</b>
        
      </p>
		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio.png"
        alt="project">
      	<p>
        	Studio Bones has been around since 1998. They're responsible for amazing anime like both iterations of Fullmetal Alchemist, My Hero Academia, Mob Psycho 100, Ouran High School Host Club, and Wolf's Rain. The studio was founded by former members of Studio Sunrise, Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi Ōsaka and Toshihiro Kawamoto.
    	</p>

		<p>
			After Ōsaka tragically died from cancer in 2007, Makoto Watanabe and Takahiro Komori joined the board of directors. Komori's artistic sensibilities even informed some shows' character design. His previous projects includes Angelic Layer, Scrapped Princess, and Darker than Black.
      	</p>

      
      <b>2. Mad House</b>
  
		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio1.png"
        alt="project">
      	<p>
        	In 1972, a group of highly-skilled animators left Mushi Production (Osamu Tezuka's studio) to found Madhouse. Since then, the studio has been producing hit after hit.
    	</p>

		<p>
			The team recruited world-class directors like Satoshi Kon and worked closely with manga artists like Naoki Urasawa and CLAMP to adapt their work into thoughtful, source-compliant anime. They're responsible for everything from Card Captor Sakura to Death Note.
      	</p>
 

       <b>3. Wit Studio</b>
  
		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio2.jpg"
        alt="project">
      	<p>
        	Wit Studio is a subsidiary of Production IG. Its debut anime, Attack on Titan, aired in 2013, and quickly earned a spot among the best anime of all time. Not too shabby for a first effort.
        </p>

		<p>
			Since then, Wit Studio has continued to astonish viewers with amazing anime like Hozuki's Coolheadedness, After The Rain, and The Ancient Magus' Bride.  
     	</p>
		

       <b>4. Kyoto Animation</b>
     
		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio3.png"
        alt="project">
      	<p>
        	Kyoto Animation is responsible for some of the most renowned anime in history, including The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, CLANNAD, and Full Metal Panic.
        </p>

		<p>
		Though their style has evolved over time, Kyoto Animation characters are always easily recognizable. The studio maintains a distinct, high-quality style by keeping a team of salaried animators on staff (as opposed to relying on freelancers). 
		</p>


       <b>5. Studio Ghibli</b>
     
		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio4.png"
        alt="project">
      	<p>
        	If you ask an average person on the street to name an anime studio, you'll probably hear about Studio Ghibli. Headed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, this studio has produced some of the most spectacular films ever created—in any medium, not just anime.
    	</p>

		<p>
			These films often combine coming-of-age stories featuring young girls with messages about the natural environment and humanity's role in its care.
		</p>

		<p>
			The studio's most famous films are My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and Spirited Away, but they've birthed plenty of other spectacular stories that are well worth watching.  
		</p>

       <b>6. MAPPA</b>
      
		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio5.png"
        alt="project">
      	<p>
        	A former Madhouse employee named Masao Maruyama started MAPPA in 2011, and since then the fledgling studio has been churning out hits. Its first anime, Kids on the Slope, is a coming-of-age story told through jazz. MAPPA is also responsible for Terror in Resonance, one of the few anime that directly confronts the issue of terrorism. 
        </p>

		<p>
			Yuri on Ice!!! is another original series that centers on two men falling in love with each other through the power of ice skating. MAPPA takes on subject matter other studios won't, which has helped it stand out in a relatively short span of time. 
		</p>



       <b>7. Sunrise</b>

		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio7.png"
        alt="project">
     	<p>
        	Sunrise is one of the largest and most renowned anime studios in history. Comprised of over 10 separate studios that all work on different projects, Sunrise is responsible for hundreds of anime in countless genres.
        </p>

		<p>
			When ex-employees of Osamu Tezuka's Mushi Production formed the studio in 1972, the goal was to not prioritize the vision of any particular director (the way that Mushi had with Tezuka). Instead, they envisioned a group effort driven by the leadership of multiple producers.
		</p>

		<p>
			Eager to distinguish themselves by specializing in a specific genre, Sunrise chose to focus on mecha anime and began developing the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. Later works like Cowboy Bebop and Code Geass still focus on futuristic machinery, though Sunrise has also developed shows like Yakitake! Japan which focuses on bread-baking rather than robots. 
		</p>
 

       <b>8. A-1 Pictures</b>

		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio0.png"
        alt="project">

        </p>

		<p>
			Their first effort produced Big Windup!, a baseball anime known for its finely developed characters. Since then, A-1 Pictures has worked on popular shonen anime like Sword Art Online and Fairy Tail, while also taking on tragic romances like Your Lie in April, and down-to-earth stories like Silver Spoon. 
		</p>

       <b>9. Production IG</b>
		<img class="project-image"
        src="studio9.png"
        alt="project">
      	<p>
        	Originally, Production IG was a subsidiary of Tatsunoko Production, founded in part to keep its best animators from leaving and give them a chance to work on passion projects.
        </p>

 		<p>
 			The studio has since grown into a 120-person enterprise that's produced beloved anime like Ghost In The Shell, Psycho-Pass, Eden of the East, and Haikyu!!
